The subset Cleaned Code 1 focuses on preparing the climate data obtained from the IRRMIP repository for use in OGGM. It consists of six scripts that should be run in consecutive order, each performing an essential step of the processing workflow.The consecutive steps are:Step 1 processes the raw IRRMIP input data into monthly, seasonal, or annual perturbations (∆Irr – NoIrr) for temperature and precipitation for historic and counterfactual data, and produces plots for verification.Step 2 does the same for future data, again generating perturbations for temperature and precipitation and plotting the results.Step 3 regrids the perturbation data to W5E5 resolution so that it can be merged with the baseline climate.Step 4 extends the climate data by repeating the one-year monthly average to create a continuous 30-year time series.Step 5 prepares the OGGM input file by adding DEM data and including the required attributes and dimensions needed for use in OGGM.Step 6 provides a quick way to test the outputs by plotting the generated perturbation files.
