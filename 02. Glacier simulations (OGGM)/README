The subset Cleaned Code 1 focuses on preparing the climate data obtained from the IRRMIP repository for use in OGGM. It consists of eight scripts that should be run in consecutive order, each performing an essential step of the processing workflow.The consecutive steps are:Step 1 processes climate data to OGGM gdirs and runs the MB and Volume Evolution model for historic periodStep 2 processes climate data to OGGM gdirs and runs the MB and Volume Evolution model for future periodStep 3 processes climate data to OGGM gdirs and runs the MB and Volume Evolution model for historic period, but with P and T perturbations separateStep 4 Creates a master dataset out of historic data created in step 1Step 5 Creates a master dataset out of historic data for PT only created in step 3Step 6 Creates paper plots with historic data for the main textStep 7 Creates paper plots for future data (does not rely on a master. The master is created in this script)Step 8 Creates paper plots for the extended data section (might call data generated in step 6 and 7)
